            <p>Vision
                Our vision is to make history accessible, immersive, and engaging for everyone. By leveraging interactive maps, we aim to bridge the gap between past and present, allowing users to explore historical events, places, and narratives in a visually compelling way. We strive to create a digital space where history is not just read but experienced, fostering a deeper appreciation for the past.
                
                Mission
                Our mission is to develop an innovative platform that brings history to life through interactive maps. We are committed to:
                
                Providing Engaging Historical Content – Offering well-researched and visually rich maps that narrate historical events with accuracy and depth.
                Enhancing Learning Through Interactivity – Encouraging users to explore history dynamically through clickable markers, timelines, and multimedia content.
                Promoting Accessibility and Inclusivity – Ensuring that our platform is user-friendly, responsive, and available to diverse audiences, from history enthusiasts to educators and researchers.
                Encouraging Exploration and Discovery – Allowing users to uncover lesser-known historical narratives and perspectives through an engaging, self-guided experience.
                Fostering Community and Collaboration – Creating opportunities for historians, educators, and map enthusiasts to contribute, discuss, and expand historical knowledge.</p>
